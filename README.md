**Project Overview: Pinterest Clone**

This project serves as a comprehensive showcase of my backend development proficiency by creating a Pinterest-inspired application. Leveraging Node.js and Express.js, I've implemented a wide range of functionalities, including local authentication using Passport.js, file uploading capabilities via Multer, traditional routing features and CRUD operations.
MongoDB has been employed as the primary database solution to ensure robust data management. Furthermore, the front end has been meticulously styled using Tailwind CSS, enhancing the user interface and overall user experience.
The inclusion of Passport.js for local authentication adds an extra layer of security and user management, demonstrating my expertise in implementing authentication systems within web applications.

This repository stands as a testament to my full-stack development skills, encompassing backend logic and secure user authentication. Feel free to explore the codebase to gain insights into the techniques and best practices utilized in this project.
